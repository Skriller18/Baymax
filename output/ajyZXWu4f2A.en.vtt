Hello and welcome back!

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:08.629
Today we will look at conversation for&nbsp;
receptionists at a doctor's office.

and how to speak with patients&nbsp;
in person and over the phone

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.149
Let's begin!

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.709
A receptionist is someone&nbsp;
who handles the front desk.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.229
Some important vocabulary for a receptionist&nbsp;
who works at a doctor's office is:

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:40.229

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.789
and prescription

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.469
Next, it's important to remember that&nbsp;
good communication is very important.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.429

laboratories

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.309
and pharmacies

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.709
Some duties include:

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.109
and phone numbers

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.109
When you work as a receptionist you will&nbsp;
be answering phone calls all day long.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.189

use over and over again is:
